## Documentation
Curious about the work we're engaging in? Visit our Jira Dashboard to view our current sprint progress, or view our current issue list here. Our documentation is open too - check out our Confluence site.

## Technology
Our frontend is built in React and integrates an open-source, headless content management system microservice called Strapi. Please peruse and reuse what we’ve built — it’s all shared in the open here on GitHub.

## How to get your content on digital.gov.bc.ca
If you have insights, stories or resources you think should be offered on digital.gov.bc.ca, please reach out to our Product Owner, Arlen.Tees@gov.bc.ca.

If you have content that is identified to be added to the site, here’s how we can work with you:

1. **Research** — Our designer and researcher will meet with you to understand the goals you have for your content, what kind of interaction/interface features may be required, and who should have oversight over publication.
1. **Estimation** — Our designer and developer will discuss your requirements and estimate the work it will take to implement.
1. **Prioritization** — Once estimated, our product owner will prioritize the work in our product backlog.
1. **Design** — Once the work has been moved into our current sprint, we’ll get back in touch to collaborate with you on a content model and wireframe to represent how your content will look in production.
1. **Development** — Once you and we are happy with the design, our developer will create the new content and grant you access to the content management system. (Not making promises, but he’s getting pretty fast at this!)
1. **Content Management Orientation** — Finally, we’ll show you around the CMS to make sure you're confident in how to publish and maintain your content.
