The sysdig template is how sysdig users are added and removed from the project.  Note this cannot be done through the Sysdig GUI.

Documentation on how to work with this can be found [Here](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/OpenShift-User-Guide-to-Creating-and-Using-a-Sysdig-Team-for-Monitoring)

Help can be found on the Rocket Chat channel `#devops-sysdig`.
