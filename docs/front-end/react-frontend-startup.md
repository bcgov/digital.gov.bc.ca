## Building and Deploying the frontend on Openshift
Check out the [ansible docs](ansible/README.md) for all available playbooks. 

You can create builds from a PR by running `ansible-playbook ansible/build-react.yaml -e PR=<pr num>`.

This will only build for __PRs that are open__. This is to prevent the inadvertent promotion of closed or erroneous PR's. This will also only build for PRs generated by one of the repo collaborators. This is to ensure only valid users are able to build and deploy.

By default, this will also only create a `Buildconfig`, however you can trigger a Deployment in the __dev namespace__. To do this run the playbook with `-e deploy=true`


## Running Images

`ansible-playbook ansible/deploy-react.yaml -e PR=<pr num>`

## Promoting Images to Test or Production

`ansible-playbook ansible/promote-environment.yaml -e ENV=test|prod -e IMAGE_TAG=<image tag>`

If you deployed a PR, then the image tag will follow the pattern `pr-<pr num>`.

If you want to see what image tags are available to promote you can run 

`oc -n xdwidw-tools get imagestreamtag`


The promotion strategy is to retag an image from tools namespace and stick it into test or prod namespaces with the `test` or `prod` tags respectively

## Rolling Back to a Stable PR

> Warning!! This may not work if there have been stateful configuration changes to things like databases!

As a bailout you can build and deploy a dev instance of a PR. This is essentially the `build-react` script
minus the preflight checks

run `ansible-playbook ansible/rollback-react.yaml -e PR=<>`
