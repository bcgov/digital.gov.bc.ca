        Once you’ve notified the successful vendor that you have selected their
        solution, you will move to the purchase and implementation phase. The
        steps in this phase may include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Documenting the evaluation process that led to the selection of the
          SaaS product you’re purchasing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Completing a contract pre-approval process and contract checklist.
        </li>
        <li>
          Obtaining an authorized signature (likely from your ADM) on the SaaS
          Master Services Agreement, Terms of Use, Additional Terms (… whichever
          apply) with terms negotiated to meet BC requirements.
        </li>
        <li>Sending the agreement to the SaaS vendor for their signature.</li>
        <li>
          Sending the signed copy of the agreement to your finance team so they
          can set up the contract in CAS.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Ongoing contract management is particularly important for SaaS
        solutions. This can include ensuring the vendor completes any annual
        reporting requirements relative to security certifications and audits.
