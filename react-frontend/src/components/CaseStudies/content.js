      BC’s mining industry is an integral part of the economy, with over $9
      billion dollars in annual revenue. Following the collapse of a mine
      tailings dam in 2014, the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum
      Resources (EMPR) sought to improve the way it used technology for record
      management, mine oversight, and to provide information to the public.
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        The Ministry’s team of designers, user-researchers, and developers uses
        an iterative, open-sourced, user-focused approach to develop products
        continuously, in the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Identifying user needs.</strong> First, the team conducts
            user research and develops user stories to better understand the
            problem they need to solve. Often, this process identifies user
            needs that could not be defined up front.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Testing small pieces.</strong> Next, the team develops
            prototypes and works with users to validate that it is solving the
            right problems and delivering simple and easy-to-use services. The
            team fosters creativity and innovation by conducting hackathons and
            inviting members of the local technology community to collaborate.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Delivering value quickly.</strong> Once the team has solved
            a problem, it delivers its product to users to use immediately with
            real data. The team uses feedback from users to identify user needs,
            repeating the process.

            set its sights on developing a modern mine oversight system capable
            of sharing real-time mine data and interacting directly with mines.
            The new system reduces the time to gather a major mine’s regulatory

            industry, Indigenous communities, stakeholders, and the public. By
            enhancing usability, efficiency, and transparency, this system will
            transform the province’s regulation of mines.

            the levels of key soil nutrients like phosphate and nitrogen into

            would require – or the amount of nutrients that would need to be
            removed from the soil to meet environmental regulations and prevent
            pollution. This in-person testing showcased the learning

        <strong>Important research.</strong> After two rounds of interviews and
        prototype testing with farmers, the Ministry had a clearer picture of
        how to support farmers with their soil management. The service design
        process highlighted the need to engage with farmers when designing
        informational resources; the research showed that the calculator was a
        useful tool to help farmers monitor and manage the nutrients in their
        soils, but it needed to be a part of a larger education and outreach
        program.

        <strong>Hit the ground running.</strong> As a result of working with the
        Service Design Team, the Ministry was able to “hit the ground running”
        when it moved into the technical build of the online calculator and
        other resources. The project team worked at the Exchange Lab on the
        technical builds and created a roadmap of activities and actions to
        support the development of these resources – from brochures, to website
        information and the calculator.

        <strong>Ongoing impact.</strong> User research helped define the

        principles that the Ministry has been using when developing other

        Working together, the Ministry of Health and the Service Design Team
        took an iterative, citizen-focused approach to the development of online
        services.
      </p>
      <p>The project included three key phases:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Desk and field research.</strong> First, a jurisdictional
            analysis of health insurance plans in Canada was completed. Then,
            the team spoke with 62 people across B.C., including First Nations
            health authorities support workers, Service BC frontline staff,
            Health Insurance BC customer service managers, third-party support
            workers and residents.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Prototyping and testing.</strong> The team took an agile
            approach to design and development and engaged citizens and key
            stakeholders in prototyping and testing to improve the usability of
            the digital forms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Implementing better services.</strong> Once basic working
            online forms were developed MSP and Premium Assistance enrolment,
            they were released to the public without marketing or advertising.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  ),
  outcomes: (
    <div>
      <p>
        <strong>Iteration is key.</strong> Even though the online enrolment
        forms were released without marketing or advertising, over 1,000
        applications were submitted in the first week. The team tracked
        application error rates, which after launch initially dropped but soon
        bounced back up. The team identified the key issues, came up with a
        solution and ultimately brought the error rate down to its current one
        percent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Normalizing the conversation about data. </strong>The project
        focused on a data-driven approach to service delivery and prototyped and
        tested solutions based on statistical evidence and user research – even
        with limited government resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Improve the service, then improve delivery.</strong> A key
        insight from research was that before government invests in the digital
        delivery of services, they first need to improve the service itself. The
        project demonstrated the value that service design brings to digital
        transformation, both in healthcare and other government services.
