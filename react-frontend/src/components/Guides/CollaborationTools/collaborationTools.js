        <p>
          When you can’t meet with your coworkers or clients face-to-face,
          communicating with them by video can be the next best thing.
          Fortunately, there are many options available for video communication
          platforms or tools, many of which can also be used for instant
          messaging or chat, screen sharing and transferring files. These
          options vary by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cost</li>
          <li>
            Compatibility (some may require a download, while others work in a
            web browser)

          <strong>Privacy and Security</strong>
        </Title2>
        <p>
          Video communication platforms are crucial to working remotely, but it
          is important to ensure that use of these tools addresses privacy,
          security and legal risks. Here we provide some general considerations
          and information to assist broader public sector entities in
          determining which platforms may be suitable for their particular
          needs. Broader public sector entities are encouraged to consult their
          privacy and security experts and to seek legal advice as appropriate
          based on their intended use of a particular tool.

          – issued during the COVID-19 public health emergency – allows
          disclosure of personal information outside Canada in specific
          circumstances. One of these circumstances allows public bodies to use
          third-party tools or applications such as video communication
          platforms, which may be hosted outside Canada, to support and maintain
          the operation of programs or activities of the public body where such
          use supports public health recommendations or requirements related to
          minimizing transition of COVID-19 (e.g., social distancing, working
          from home, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministerial Order 085 also outlines conditions for the use of these

          from the tools or applications as soon as possible when the order
          expires (June 30, 2020, unless rescinded or extended); and records
          created using these tools or applications are managed appropriately.

        <Title3>Security measures</Title3>
        <p>
          Security measures should be proportional to the sensitivity of
          information. The more sensitive the information, the more secure it
          should be. For example, your health information is more sensitive than
          your opinion of the weather, so it would be reasonable to expect your
          health information be protected to a higher degree. If you are an
          employee of a broader public sector entity and your job includes
          sharing potentially personal, sensitive or confidential information,
          you are encouraged to consult your organization for specific guidance
          on which tools to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information provided below is for general informational purposes
          only and does not replace the need for broader public sector
          organizations to conduct their own due diligence, including seeking
          legal advice, where appropriate, on video communication platform use
          within their organization.

        <Title2>Security best practices and tips</Title2>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Determine whether you will be sharing
            personal/sensitive/confidential or public information.{' '}
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>Some questions to ask:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How sensitive is the information that I will be sharing or
            processing over my intended platform or tool?
          </li>
          <li>
            Is it okay if other people, aside from my intended audience, have
            access to this information without my knowledge?
          </li>
          <li>
            Who would want to steal this information and does my intended
            platform or tool protect this information from them?
          </li>
          <li>
            What are the risks to sharing this information, and is my
            organization willing to accept those risks to achieve our business
            objectives? Are there any risks that must be addressed in order to
            ensure compliance with legislative requirements?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your information is personal/sensitive/confidential, ensure the
          tool you are using has sufficient security controls in place to
          protect the information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Choose a service provider with strong security and privacy policies
            and features.{' '}
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Consider how the service provider responds to privacy breaches and
            security incidents. Look for a reliable provider who proactively
            engages their customers to address privacy and security issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be familiar with and comply with the service provider’s customer use
            and responsibility policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seek advice from your organization’s privacy and security experts
            and legal advisors before using any tool or agreeing to any terms
            and conditions. That way, you can avoid inadvertently accepting
            terms and conditions that breach your organization’s security
            requirements (e.g., if the service provider claims ownership of any
            recorded conversations, content, metadata, or files shared over
            their platform).
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider the service provider’s encryption standards. They should be
            encrypting data while it is in transit <em>and</em> at rest. Strong
            encryption, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), is necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Find out what personal and potentially sensitive information the
            service provider collects about meeting participants. For example,
            do they collect names, roles, organizations, email addresses,
            usernames, passwords, or the devices used? Learn how the service
            provider will use this information and let participants know what to
            disclose during registration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use different passwords and credentials than the ones you use for
            your work accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compare the privacy and security features offered between providers
            and between subscription plans. You may discover a paid-for plan
            offers better security than a free one.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Set up a secure video conference or meeting.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Modify the meeting’s settings when the default settings do not meet
            your organization’s security requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Send invitations securely. Use email or encrypted messaging apps to
            send links to your meeting. Do not share links or access credentials
            over public websites or social media.
          </li>
          <li>
            Update your access credentials periodically to reduce the risk of
            uninvited guests at your future meetings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Choose a secure physical setting.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Host your video conference from a private location. If you can’t
            find one, use headphones so that only meeting participants can hear
            the full discussion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider muting participants. This eliminates background noise and
            prevents nearby private or confidential discussions from being
            overheard.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider what others can see behind you. Remove or conceal anything
            that should be kept private. Some video communication tools (e.g.,
            MS Teams) let you blur the background or use a virtual background.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check that meeting participants have also secured their physical
            setting and devices.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Limit and monitor meeting participants.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Consider who you allow to join your meeting. You can restrict access
            by requiring participants to enter a password to join. You can also
            allow authenticated users only, or registered or domain-verified
            users only (i.e., people whose email addresses include approved
            domains). On some tools, you can make participants wait in virtual
            lobbies before they join the meeting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Watch or listen for cues that someone has joined the meeting. Ask
            participants to identify themselves when they join by phone. Do not
            share information if unidentified participants are in your meeting.
          </li>
          <li>Lock the meeting once all participants have joined.</li>
          <li>
            Learn how to eject unwanted participants quickly and prevent them
            from re-joining.
          </li>
          <li>
            Invite a participant to co-host the meeting. Having two people in
            control means you can deal with unwanted participants or content
            faster.
          </li>

          <li>
            Review your settings for screen sharing, annotation or private
            messaging, or chat. Limiting or disabling these channels will avert
            unauthorized content and other distractions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Share an application rather than the entire screen, if you need to
            show your screen to others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not click on suspicious links or attachments sent via chat or
            emails about the platform or tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before you upload or share a document, consider whether it is
            appropriate. For example, documents where the copyright is owned by
            a third party should not be shared, unless your organization has a
            license that permits this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notify participants in advance if you will be recording or

            your organization’s policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not use private messaging for confidential information, as hosts

        </Title3>
        <p>
          During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many of you across the
          B.C. public sector may be using the free version of Zoom to
          communicate with colleagues and clients. Please be aware of the
          privacy and security vulnerabilities – primarily, weak encryption that
          generally falls short of B.C. government standards. This vulnerability
          means information is not adequately protected. If you are sharing
          confidential information, do not use Zoom if you have access to a
          secure alternative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other vulnerabilities include the ability for hackers to steal your
          Windows login credentials, and for uninvited participants to join and
          disrupt your Zoom meetings – called “Zoombombing.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is up to each broader public sector entity to determine whether
          Zoom is appropriate for use within that organization. Broader public
          sector entities are encouraged to consult with their privacy and
          security experts and legal advisors to assess the risks associated
          with their intended use of Zoom. Where a broader public sector entity
          has determined that the use of Zoom is appropriate within its
          organization, the following steps can be taken to improve the security
          of the free version of Zoom.

          <strong>General tips</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Use the web version of Zoom </strong>on your desktop or
            laptop.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ensure the Zoom client app is the current version</strong>{' '}
            and regularly check for updates. For more information on installing
            apps, read the{' '}

            .
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Use your full first and last name for your Zoom account
            </strong>{' '}
            (e.g., firstname_lastname, or Jane_Smith). This helps the meeting
            host verify participants against the invitation list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do not use your organization credentials </strong>to log
            into Zoom.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose a strong password (see{' '}

            ) and change your password immediately if you think someone may have
            access to your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Do not use the “Personal Meeting ID” option to host events
            </strong>
            . Instead, allow Zoom to automatically generate a random meeting ID
            for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Do not share your meeting link on social media or other public
              forums,
            </strong>{' '}
            and ask participants not to share the link as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Password protect your meeting when possible.</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Setting up a meeting</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Set screen sharing to “Host Only.</strong>” This allows you,
            as the host, to reject any unwanted content from participants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disable “Join Before Host.</strong>” Instead, use the
            “Waiting Room” feature to admit participants and keep out uninvited
            guests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enable “Co-Host</strong>” if you (as the host) want to
            assign moderating duties to other participants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Be aware of everything your camera can see around you
            </strong>{' '}
            (e.g., family photos, sensitive documents).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>During a meeting</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Verify participants </strong>by comparing names against the
            invitation list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lock the meeting</strong> once all attendees have joined to
            prevent uninvited guests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disable “Allow Removed Participants to Rejoin.”</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disable “File Transfer” </strong>and do not click on links
            or open attachments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do not use Zoom’s cloud storage</strong>. You can stream or
            edit documents that do not have any personal, sensitive or
            confidential information, but do not upload or save documents onto
            Zoom’s cloud storage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do not record meetings</strong> unless necessary and with
            proper authority under the{' '}
            <em>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.</em> If
            you do record a meeting, save the recording locally and never in
            Zoom’s cloud storage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Disclose personal information only if your organization has
              determined that it is appropriate and lawful to do so, and limit
              any disclosure of personal information
            </strong>{' '}
            to the minimum amount reasonably necessary for performing your
            duties as an employee, officer or minister of the public body. In
            other words, consider what personal information is needed to get the
            job done and only share that information via Zoom.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Turn off video and/or audio by default</strong> when joining
            a meeting (in Zoom Settings) to protect your privacy.

          <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Zoom collects account information, including IP addresses, usage
            analytics, names, email addresses, credit card information for the
            host account, product interaction analytics, and content uploaded,
            provided or created on Zoom, as well as metadata.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zoom is based in the United States and may store data outside
            Canada. Your organization will need to assess whether the use of
            Zoom, including for meetings that may include the collection and/or
            disclosure of personal information, is appropriate and lawful.
