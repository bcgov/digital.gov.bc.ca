## Building and Deploying

The build and deploy are controlled by ansible play books

### Dependancies

- ansible 2.9.10
- Python 2.7.16 (newer versions work but may have unexpected errors when it comes to processing openshift templates)
  - pip modules: kubernetes, openshift (`pip install kubernetes openshift`)
- access to an openshift cluster
- logged into openshift
- access to multiple namespaces as defined the group vars file
- oc >= 3.11


## The workflow

The workflow is a hybrid between Github and git flow. The ansible playbooks allow developers to build and deploy their PR's to Dev and then subsequent playbooks will promote by retagging their images to the _git flow_ dev/test/prod instances 


## Available Playbooks 
### Build React
Builds the React Image from an open pull request. The Build is optimized to not retrigger builds of the buildconfig `git commit` matches the PR `head commit`. This is so that this script may be utilized in a ci/cd pipeline. The build also checks that the PR is raised by a valid user (one of the collaborators on the repo).

Options: 
- `PR` <number> this should be an open Pull Request number
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` <string> a token that has permissions to query for repo collaborators
 
Usage:

`ansible-playbook build-react.yaml -e PR=<pr num> -e GITHUB_TOKEN=<secret>`


### Deploy React

Deploys the react image to the development namespace. It will also check to see if the PR based image exists prior to building. 

Options:
- `PR` <number> this should be the open pull request number

Usage:
`ansible-playbook deploy-strapi.yaml -e PR=<pr num>`

### Build Strapi

Builds the Strapi Image from an open pull request. The Build is optimized to not retrigger builds of the buildconfig `git commit` matches the PR `head commit`. This is so that this script may be utilized in a ci/cd pipeline. 

Options: 
- `PR` <number> this should be an open Pull Request number
- `force_build` <boolean> (defaults to `false`) skip checking if previous build commit matches current head commit in PR 

Usage:

`ansible-playbook build-strapi.yaml -e PR=<pr num>`


### Deploy Strapi

Deploys the strapi image to the development namespace. It will also check to see if the PR based image exists prior to building. 

Options:
- `PR` <number> this should be the open pull request number

Usage:
`ansible-playbook deploy-strapi.yaml -e PR=<pr num>`

### Deploy Mongo

Deploys a mongo replica set that is annoted with the PR number. This is because the mongo datbase should always be coupled with a strapi deployment. 

Options:
- `PR` <number> this should be the open pull request number

Usage:
`ansible-playbook deploy-mongo.yaml -e PR=<pr num>`

### Create Github Deployment
> currently this only creates deployments for the react app and is best utilized by our custom github action

Creates a github deployment for a PR. 

Options:
- `PR` <number> this should be the open pull request number
- `ENV` <string> (dev|test|prod) used to create the github deployment in a specific environment
- `OPENSHIFT_SERVER_URL` <string> the uri to the cluster 
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` <string> a token that has permissions to create github deployments/statuses

Usage:

`ansible-playbook ansible/create-gh-deployment.yaml -e PR=5 -e ENV=dev -e GITHUB_TOKEN=<secret> -e OPENSHIFT_SERVER_URL=https://console..`

### Promote Environment
> this currently is only configured to promote our react based deployments. It is not ready to promote mongo/strapi deployments

Promotes a React PR to the test and production namespaces. This is done by Importing the dev image into the respective namespaces and triggering a rollout. 

Current workflow is to base this on a PR from develop branch to the master branch. Complete the merge of code once the deployment is complete.

Options:
- `IMAGE_TAG` <string> This is the image tag in the tools namespace's digital-gov-frontend image stream.
- `ENV` <string> (test|prod) used to create the github deployment in a specific environment

Usage:
`ansible-playbook ansible/promote-environment.yaml -e ENV=test|prod -e IMAGE_TAG=<image tag>`

### Backup and Restore Mongo
Create a pod in Openshift to perform a back and restore process. This will target a specific mongo stateful set for the backup. And attempt to restore it with the backup pod as verification. 

Options:
- `PR` <number> this should be the open pull request number

Usage:
`ansible-playbook backup-restore-mongo.yaml -e PR=<pr num>`
