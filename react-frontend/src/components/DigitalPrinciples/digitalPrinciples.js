        Digital Principles for the Government of British Columbia (Version 1.0)
      </DigitalPrinciplesTitle>

      <p>
        The Digital Principles are meant to guide the work of individual public
        servants and vendor partners as the Province of British Columbia
        continues to evolve into a{' '}
        <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/">Digital Government</a>. This
        includes everything from the day-to-day work of individuals to the
        design, development and delivery of digital products and services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Digital Principles were co-developed with BC public service
        employees and members of the wider community. The principles are meant
        to be considered as a set rather than individually as there is
        purposeful overlap among them. They should also be considered within a
        wider context, which includes but isn’t limited to:

            Draft Principles that Guide the Province of British Columbia’s
            Relationship with Indigenous Peoples

      </ul>
      <p>The Province’s Digital Principles are: </p>

      <DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
        1. Deliver value for British Columbians & cultivate trust
      </DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
      <p>
        Recognize that government products and services should ultimately
        improve people’s lives. Build products and services for outcomes rather
        than outputs, prioritizing according to citizens' needs. Use resources
        judiciously to benefit citizens and BC’s homegrown digital economy.
        Build trust in every interaction, using data to make fair, ethical and
        evidence-based decisions.
      </p>
      <DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
        2. Design with people & embed inclusion
      </DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
      <p>
        Deliver simple, effective products and services in response to citizens'
        needs. Apply human-centered design practices, working directly with
        people who will use the product or service. Communicate in plain
        language. Strive to meet the highest standards of accessibility,
        inclusion and equity. Endeavour to create a seamless experience across
        government’s various digital and physical channels.
      </p>

      <DigitalPrinciplesHeading>3. Integrate ethics</DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
      <p>
        Take an ethical approach to designing or modifying digital products and
        services. Evaluate the potential ethical, social, cultural and
        environmental implications of emerging priorities. Ensure there is clear
        oversight and documentation for automated decision-making processes
        (e.g. when using artificial intelligence).
      </p>

      <DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
        4. Continuously learn & improve
      </DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
      <p>
        Iterate and improve products and services to support learning and
        innovation. Use modern tools and approaches. Be flexible to change, even
        at the last minute. Seek and accept feedback on an ongoing basis. Test
        early and often. Try to “fail fast" and accept failures as learning
        opportunities.
      </p>

      <DigitalPrinciplesHeading>5. Work in the open</DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
      <p>
        Collaborate, co-design and co-create with product and service users
        transparently. Default towards open licenses, open and interoperable
        standards and open-source code. Share information and data whenever
        possible.
      </p>

      <DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
        6. Take an ecosystem approach
      </DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
      <p>
        Think holistically. Design and deliver forward-thinking, adaptable and
        scalable solutions. Support interoperability, common components and
        enterprise approaches. Share work and learnings with the aim of
        contributing to the wider community. Strive to collect data from users
        only once, re-using and sharing data whenever possible.
      </p>

      <DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
        7. Take care of information & data
      </DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
      <p>
        Act as a trusted information steward. Manage information, including
        data, as a public asset in accordance with its value and user needs.
        Strive to improve the quality of information and data. Recognize that
        people own their personal data and have a stake in how it’s used. Work
        with citizens to ensure they understand how and why government collects
        their information.
      </p>

      <DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
        8. Manage risks proportionatel
      </DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
      <p>
        Promote a risk-balanced approach that addresses security and privacy by
        design. Recognize risks associated with maintaining the status quo —
        remember that no decision is also a decision. Design clear and flexible
        risk-mitigation strategies.
      </p>

      <DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
        9. Build diverse teams & internal capacity
      </DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
      <p>
        Empower all public servants and vendor partners to deliver excellent
        products and services. Create and support teams with diverse skillsets
        and backgrounds. Enable teams to use technology as an effective
        collaboration tool. Encourage innovation and controlled experimentation.
        Build an organizational culture and structure to support constant
        learning and engagement.
      </p>

      <DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
        10. Express cultural & historical awareness & respect
      </DigitalPrinciplesHeading>
      <p>
        Acknowledge the historical relationships, inequity, trauma, and
        discrimination created by government. Work in the spirit of
        reconciliation and{' '}

          B.C.’s Draft Principles
        </a>{' '}
        guiding our relationship with Indigenous peoples. Respect that First
        Nations have control over data-collection processes in their
        communities, and that they own their information and control how it can
        be used.
